Tiny Accelerometers Acquisition System

The aim of this project is to realize a small acquisition system of a triaxial accelerometer connected via serial interface to a pc or tablet, using an appropriate adapter as TTL/USB or TTL/Bluetooth.
However, this system can also be used for other sensors with the same output range.
